# Introductory Machine Learning 2023 FALL

This repository is the slides and notes for Introductory Machine Learning 2023 Fall.

I mostly focus on how to get familiar with popular tools ([`Conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/), [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/), [`fastai`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai)) and architecture (CNN, Transformer). When teaching, I would open two tabs: one for slides, the other for an empty Jupyter Notebook. And I would constantly refer to Official Documentation, Wiki, GitHub repository, etc.
